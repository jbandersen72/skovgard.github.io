	<p>What is the immersive fallacy?
How can video games be confused for reality when its players view them as escapism and freedom from reality? In their book Rules of Play, scholars Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric Zimmerman argue that there are significant flaws in our understanding of video games and what exactly constitutes immersion.
	<br>
	<br>
	The idea video game players can reach a state where they forget they are playing a game is a common misconception. Salen and Zimmerman call this the “immersive fallacy.” That is, the idea that players believe their gaming “reality is so complete…that the player truly believes that he or she is part of an imaginary world” is false.
	<br>
	<br>
	Instead Salen and Zimmerman say players are “well-aware of the artificiality of the play situation.” In fact, this artificiality is one of the things that makes games so entertaining.
	<br>
	<br>
	Let’s take an example.

        <h2>Scene from Battlefield 1 (2016)</h2>
         <p>In this scene from Battlefield 1 (2016), a first-person shooter is set during the First World War and player action and interaction shifts between several roles. Players start by driving a tank and firing at enemies, but when the tank gets stuck in mud an enemy attack at close quarters quickly follows.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Ominous, indistinct music begins as the player is trapped in the tank, but the sounds of gunshots overwhelm the action. Soon, however, the character is deafened by a gunshot. Ambient noise of weapon fire is silenced to reveal underlying music featuring  trumpet and trombone flares, giving it a militaristic feel.

        The player releases a messenger pigeon, and a shift of character occurs. Keenly aware of this shift because the style of gameplay completely changes, the player’s role is now to fly the pigeon to its destination, seeing the world literally from a bird’s-eye view.

         <h2>Players know their games are not reality</h2> It’s not surprising the general public is confused about immersion. Even gamers don’t really have a consistent understanding of what “immersion” means, partly because they use the word in two different ways.

         Anecdotally, gamers often use the term to refer to the depth and level of detail of the game world, but colloquially it’s also used to refer to how addicting a game is. This ambiguity is also brought up in a 2008 study in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies that examines how exactly to measure immersion.

         Players might describe how they were “totally immersed” in a rousing game of Tetris, but this hardly means they believe they exist in a universe where four-unit blocks might crush them at any point while accompanied by a Russian folk song, for example.

        Gamers talk about Skyrim as having an immersive game world, with its own politics, religions and even literature (reading the books you find in Skyrim is surprisingly entertaining). But part of the appeal of Skyrim are the unique features of that game world: The ability to cast spells, treasure hunt and play as non-human races.
