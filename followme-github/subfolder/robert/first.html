	<p>Despite controversy over a supposed connection between violence and video games (hint: there isn’t any), numerous academic studies indicate that playing video games has many psychological and even physical benefits.
	<br>
	<br>
	There’s many scientific researches that have proven this fact. I know it might be hard to believe such a thing after pretty much everything you’ve heard all your childhood was “Get away from that screen and go play outside”, but here’s a few reasons why video games are actually good for you:

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
         <p>Playing video games is a great way to exercise your brain, since most games require you to think about pretty much everything you do, especially if there are some puzzles involved or some catch to some stage you can’t wrap your mind around.
        <br> 
        <br> 
        What’s more, playing video games may actually slow down aging with as little as 10 hours of game-play over 5-8 weeks, just like keeping your body in shape, you brain cells can also be kept “in shape”.
        This cool grandma is the perfect example, she has a YouTube channel with over 700 videos and she goes by the name of Shirley Curry, she's most famous for her Skyrim series.</p>

         <h2>Skills</h2> Different types of games can train different parts of the brain. Studies have shown that for example people who play racing and shooter games tend to have much better reflexes and reaction time.
         <br>
         <br>
         People who play strategy games are more comfortable with multitasking, since they are used to have their attention faced towards lots of different situations occuring during the game.
         <br>
         <br>
         Action games are fast-paced, with lots of events popping up and disappearing, these games teach players to become better at taking in sensory data and translating it into better, correct decision.

        <h2>Anti-social</h2> <p>It’s not uncommon for gamers to be looked upon as anti-social people who live in their mother’s basements drinking coke and eating chips all day, but that’s not mostly true.In fact, it turns out that games can help you be more social, or overcome social anxiety.
        <br>
        <br>
         Researchers from three different institutions in the UK and Canada recently did their own studies to find out how common antisocial behavior is among gamers, and could you guess what happened.
         <br>
         <br>
         What each one discovered is that gamers who partake in live social environments are actually the most communicative and friendly people there, and he even went on to admit that they formed stronger relationships than non-gamers due to their matching love of games.</p>

            <h2>Hand-eye coordination</h2> <p>There’s plenty of professions that require better hand-eye coordination than the average person, let’s take surgeons as a very good example.They rely on theirs not only to perform successful operations but also to make sure they don’t nick any artery or vital organ.That’s why a lot of aspiring surgeons are now required to perform virtual surgeries for training. </p>
